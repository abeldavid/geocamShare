Contributing to GeoCam
=========================================

The GeoCam Project develops open source software and we welcome your
contributions.  We think making tools to help disaster responders share
information in the field is just about the greatest job in the world,
and if you have the time to help us, that's awesome.  You're really
doing some important public service.

If you're a developer and want to get involved, here are some ways you
can do that:

 * We use ``git`` and the GitHub web site to manage our source code.
   You can read up on these tools at the `GitHub help pages`_.

 * Try using the `interactive demo version`_ of GeoCam Share.  This is a
   read-only version that can give you a feel for how the display works.

 * If you find any bugs, you can help us out by reporting them at the
   `issue tracker`_.  You can get to the issue tracker by clicking
   on the ``Issues`` button from any GeoCam repository on GitHub.  You
   can also vote on which bugs are most important to you.

 * Try installing GeoCam Share from source following `these directions`_.
   (If you're thinking of contributing changes, you'll want to use
   ``git`` to grab the source instead of clicking the ``Downloads``
   button.)  Please report any errors you find in our installation
   instructions using the issue tracker.

 * If you have any questions, ask on the `geocam-questions group`_.
   That will also give us a chance to get to know you, which will make
   things easier if you want to contribute code later.

 * You're free to test whatever changes you like in your local repository,
   and you can share them (subject to the `NASA Open Source Agreement`_) by
   `forking`_ our repository on GitHub and pushing your changes there.

 * If we like your changes, we might incorporate them into the master copy
   of GeoCam.  But remember:

   * We only take changes if they fit with our project goals and our
     coding style.  You have better odds of getting your changes
     accepted if we've talked about them in advance.

   * Unfortunately, we can only take changes if you have signed our
     contributor license agreement (see below).  That agreement is what
     lets us legally redistribute your changes under the NOSA.

   * To give us a change, push it to your fork on GitHub, then send us a
     `pull request`_ so we can pull it from there.  (Or if you prefer,
     send a pull request via email with any explanation needed, no need
     to get formal.)
